# Purpose

Enhance the homepage with clickable links and add Claude Code test functionality

## Original Ask
In the homepage, Do the following. Make existing links (where user is supposed to navigate to for confirming the setup) clickable, and then add new link with full functionality. `test-claude`, that checks the claude code functionality, sends just "hello there!" as a message with system message "You are a star wars nerd, and the person who greets you, have been following star wars since they were kid". Print any error upfront if it happens during the flow of test-claude

## Complexity and the reason behind it

## Architectural changes required

None required, the existing architecture supports adding new routes and handlers.

## Backend changes required

1. Convert homepage from plain text to HTML with clickable links
2. Create a new handler for `/test-claude` endpoint  
3. Integrate with Claude API using the stored API key from KV storage

## Frontend changes required

1. Create an HTML homepage with proper styling and clickable links
2. Add a test results page for Claude API response
3. Include error display for failed API calls

## Acceptance Criteria

Not applicable (complexity < 3)

## Validation

1. Navigate to homepage and verify all links are clickable
2. Click on `/test-claude` link to test Claude Code functionality  
3. Verify Star Wars themed response from Claude
4. Test error handling by temporarily removing API key and checking error display
